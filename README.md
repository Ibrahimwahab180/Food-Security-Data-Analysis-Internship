🌾 Food Security Data Analysis Internship Portfolio (Weeks 1 - 6)

Project Overview

This repository documents my six-week data analysis internship focusing on global food security, specifically investigating the complex relationship between economic indicators (GDP, Income Inequality) and agricultural productivity (Crop Yield) on the prevalence of Undernourishment.

The primary goal of this project was to move beyond simple correlations to identify moderating and mediating factors that either hinder or help the translation of economic growth into improved food security outcomes.

📈 Key Findings & Visualizations (Weeks 1-6 Summary)

Week 1 & 2: Initial Correlation and Data Integration

Objective: Clean and combine initial datasets (Undernourishment, GDP, Crop Yield) and establish baseline trends.
Finding: A clear, but not perfect, inverse correlation between GDP per capita and Undernourishment was found. While wealthier countries generally have lower hunger rates, the variability suggested other critical factors are at play.

Week 3 & 4: The Role of Economic Stability vs. Growth

Objective: Investigate how economic stability factors (like the GINI Index for inequality) moderate the GDP-hunger relationship.
Finding: We established that Income Inequality (GINI Index) is a powerful moderator. High inequality significantly weakens the positive effect of increasing GDP on reducing hunger. Economic growth in highly unequal societies does not efficiently reach the poorest populations.

Week 5 & 6: Mediation Analysis (GDP → Crop Yield → Undernourishment)

Objective: Determine if improvements in agricultural production (Crop Yield) act as a mediator that helps overcome the inequality barrier and directly links economic capability (GDP) to food security.
Finding: The mediation model confirmed that Crop Yield acts as a partial mediator. Economic development (GDP) facilitates higher agricultural yields, which in turn leads to lower undernourishment rates. This suggests that investment in agricultural efficiency is a key leverage point for improving food security, even in unequal societies.

📊 Visual Analysis Highlights

1. The Moderating Effect of Income Inequality

This visualization shows that for countries with high inequality (high GINI), the line predicting lower hunger rates is much flatter. This visually confirms that economic growth is least effective at reducing hunger where income is concentrated at the top.

2. Mediation Model Paths

The scatter plots below visually trace the relationship used in the final mediation model:

| Path | Description | Visual Confirmation |
| Path A | GDP per capita → Crop Yield | Generally, higher GDP is associated with higher crop yields (due to investment in technology/fertilizer). |
| Path B | Crop Yield → Undernourishment | Higher crop yields are associated with lower undernourishment rates, confirming production matters. |
| Path C' | GDP per capita → Undernourishment (Direct Effect) | The remaining direct link after accounting for yield. |

3. Global Hunger Trends Over Time

The final trend analysis confirmed that while the global percentage of undernourished people has decreased over the study period, the rate of improvement varies wildly by country, reinforcing the need for targeted, context-specific interventions that address inequality and agricultural capacity.
